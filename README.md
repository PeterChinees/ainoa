This model was trained to detect multiple emotions from text. The model achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art by using an Attention LSTM with contextualized embeddings produced by a frozen BERT transformer model.

Inspired by the ![DeepMoji](https://deepmoji.mit.edu/) website from MIT, a similar application has been implemented where you can view how the Attention LSTM model captures the most important semantic information from your given input text. You can play around with the model at <https://ainoa.netlify.app>.
